Project Checkpoint: Porter Mixin Generator
1. Core Mission
Porter Mixin Generator is a tool for creating new Porter mixins, which are plugins that extend Porter's functionality for different cloud services or tools. It streamlines the process of scaffolding a new mixin by providing templates, configuration, and the necessary structure to build Porter-compatible mixins.

2. Context & Architecture Overview
The project follows a CLI-based architecture using Go and the Cobra framework. It's designed to clone and customize the "skeletor" template repository, which serves as a base for new mixins. The architecture includes template processing, file generation, and post-generation hooks. The project uses Go modules for dependency management and Mage for build automation.

5. Outstanding Tasks / To-Do
Implement ComplianceLevel variable in config
Ensure ComplianceLevel is consistently reflected in templates/template.json
Add comprehensive validation for generated mixins to ensure Porter best practices
Implement support for custom template repositories
Update documentation to reflect the latest features and usage examples
Consider adding a web-based UI for mixin generation
Update Go dependencies to the latest versions
Add more test cases for edge scenarios
Expand template options for different types of mixins (cloud-specific, tool-specific)
Enhance template validation to verify Porter compatibility
6. Handoff Notes
The project is a CLI tool that generates new Porter mixins based on the skeletor template. The main functionality is in cmd/porter-mixin-generator/main.go, which handles command-line arguments, template processing, and file generation.

Key points to understand:

The tool clones the skeletor repository and customizes it based on user input
Template processing uses Go's text/template package
The generator supports both interactive and non-interactive modes
Post-generation hooks run commands like go mod tidy after generation
The project uses Mage for build automation, with tasks defined in magefile.go
The ComplianceLevel variable allows for different levels of security and compliance features
When extending the tool, focus on maintaining compatibility with Porter's mixin architecture and ensuring generated mixins follow best practices. The template system is designed to be flexible, so new templates can be added easily.

The current implementation is stable and functional, but there's room for improvement in areas like template variety, validation, and user experience.

7. Implementation Plan for Next Phase
Phase 1: Compliance Level Consistency (2 weeks)
Audit all template files for ComplianceLevel variable usage
Update templates/template.json to properly handle ComplianceLevel
Create conditional file generation logic based on ComplianceLevel
Add tests for each compliance level generation
Phase 2: Custom Template Repositories (3 weeks)
Design repository selection and cloning mechanism
Implement URL/path validation for custom repositories
Add template compatibility checking
Update documentation with custom repository usage examples
Phase 3: Enhanced Validation (2 weeks)
Define Porter mixin best practices validation criteria
Implement validation checks for generated mixins
Add reporting mechanism for validation results
Create documentation for validation rules
Phase 4: Template Variety Expansion (3 weeks)
Research common mixin patterns for different cloud providers
Create specialized templates for AWS, Azure, GCP
Add tool-specific templates for common use cases
Update documentation with new template options
